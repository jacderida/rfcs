## Summary

Introduce the notion of clearly defined connection phases and establish directed routing network connections in conjunction with crust version 0.3 and later. The combined objective with crust proposed here for routing is to prepare for NAT traversal using UDP/uTP.

## Motivation

Starting with crust version 0.3, the API provides directional information on newly established connections.  This information is helpful for establishing a routing network with the correct topology. Already at bootstrapping it simplifies the logic for the routing node. No artificial distinction is needed for a "new bootstrap connection", as that depends on the state of the node and whether the node accepts or has connected to another node.

## Detailed design

### Rebootstrapping

A first objective is the replacement of previous conditional variables with a clean flow through states.  This enables rebootstrapping, ie. when the connections to the network are lost, routing can automatically reconnect.  The states proposed in flow-order are `Disconnected`, `Bootstrapped`, `Relocated`, `Connected`, `GroupConnected`, `Terminated`.

A full node will start at `Disconnected` and follow the states in the above order until `GroupConnected`. If a node would get disconnected then the cycle can restart at `Disconnected`.  Only when the user calls `::stop()`, does routing enter `Terminated`.  At `Terminated` the node remains active but does not accept new messages and terminates his connections to the network.

A full node that cannot bootstrap (as such `Disconnected`), but accepts a connection from another node, will jump from `Disconnected` to `Relocated` by assigning itself a name.  Otherwise its behaviour is identical to normal behaviour.

A client will have a reduced cycle: `Disconnected`, `Bootstrapped`, `Terminated`.  Rebootstrapping is achieved through cycling through the first two states.

### Asynchronous flowchart for connection management

We consider first the case where the connection is not started through crust bootstrapping.  We assume that a node `A` is either already connected into the network, or has established a relay node in the network through crust bootstrapping.  

Node A can initiate the connection without keeping state.  As a simple measure of congestion management a filter prevents A from repeating the same `ConnectRequest` within a small time frame.  On reception of the `ConnectRequest` node B needs to query the routing table (RT) and the connection cache (AR) for the address relocation validity of the new connection to A.  If B refuses the ConnectRequest for any reason, it suffices to drop the message.

On acceptance of the ConnectRequest from A, B will keep the ConnectRequest and both try to connect to A, and also send a ConnectResponse back to A.

On establishing a primary connection initiated by B, B will match this connection to the Expected Connections (which can be either ConnectRequests or ConnectResponses); upon a successful match B will store this connection in the ConnectRequest/ConnectResponse and identify itself on this connection with a direct `Hello` message.  Node A will accept the connection as an unknown connection.  On reception of the `Hello` message it can store this information together with the unknown connection.  On a successful match for the Hello, the node should attempt to match the unknown connection (which received an identifier claim in `Hello`) with a ConnectRequest or ConnectResponse in `match()`.

On establishing the first connection, it will be the initiating node `A` that will accept an unknown connection.  At this point node `A` might already have a signed ConnectResponse from B, that will also include the original ConnectRequest signed by A itself.  Either A does, or does not yet have this ConnectResponse, but it will know it does not have a matching ConnectRequest from B, and as such does not act.

Upon receiving the ConnectResponse from B, A needs to verify that the attached ConnectRequest has been correctly signed by A itself.  Upon success, A will store the ConnectResponse and try to connect to B with the connection information provided.

When this secondary connection is established on the connecting side, node A can match this new connection with the expected ConnectResponse that has been stored and send an identifying `Hello` message directly on this connection to B.

The same cycle for the unknown connection now repeats on the side of node B.  At the end of any matched unknown connection after a `Hello` directly on a connection, or a match of a new connection with an expected connection as intended through signed routing messages, the node needs to evaluate the full `match()`.

On `match()` the node will verify that both at routing level with a connection assigned to the signed `ConnectRequest` and a connection established as an unknown accepted connection, but again signed by the counterparty, in order to consolidate the primary connection and then drop the secondary connection.  At this point, this node will also confirm this is now a consolidated connection between node B and node A.

On confirmation node A will match that it received both the signed ConnectResponse with a secondary connection (potentially already dropped at this point) and accepted a connection that claimed to be node B.

On dropping the primary connection, any related state can be erased and the connection attempt failed.  All state is kept in temporary storage with a limitation on the number of active elements too.  On clearing any element from this state, the optionally corresponding connections should be dropped.

The objective of this two-way connection cycle is to ensure that any node can connect to A, and any node can connect to B, as the connection map of the network is an integral part of the routing network.  All nodes partaking need to ensure that they are fully connectible to minimise deviation from the desired connection map imposed by the routing table.

### Asynchronous flowchart for connection management for bootstrapping

With the asynchronous behaviour outlined above for two named nodes, a node can connect as a client when it has not yet obtained a name from the network, or has no desire to obtain a network name.  Bootstrapping is essential when starting up, as the node does not yet have connections to the network.  It hence has no knowledge of the nodes that exist on the network or their IP locations on the internet.  To overcome this start-up problem, the node will rely on the decentralised mechanisms provided by crust.

So when the bootstrapping is processed by the networking layer, there is no relevant contribution from the routing network.  The second diagram removes the functions that do not apply to bootstrapping, but adds the paths that are specific for bootstrapping.

As there is no exchange of routing messages in this bootstrapping process in the `match()` function, there will not be a `ConnectRequest` or a `ConnectResponse`.  So when the client identified itself as a client in the `Hello` message, node B can safely treat as such.  Likewise, node A will want to accept a bootstrap connection to a node, in this case node B, to initiate routing communications with the network.

### Integration of Address Relocation into connection management

The current mechanism of Address Relocation is compatible with the proposal here.  To activate Address Relocation a new proposal will be written that integrates Address Relocation into the `ConnectRequest`.

For clients it can be of interest to announce their relay location to the ClientManager group.  This can also be done with the `ConnectRequest`.

## Implementation blueprint

### State

Introduce a `State` object to `RoutingCore` representing the distinct states of connectedness for network entities, characterised as follows.

```rust
pub enum State {
    /// There are no connections.
    Disconnected,
    /// There are only bootstrap connections, and we do not yet have a name.
    Bootstrapped,
    /// There are only bootstrap connections, and we have received a name.
    Relocated,
    /// There are 0 < n < GROUP_SIZE routing connections, and we have a name.
    Connected,
    /// There are n >= GROUP_SIZE routing connections, and we have a name.
    GroupConnected,
    /// ::stop() has been called.
    Terminated,
}
```

### Expected Connections

The following types and events form an integral part of the connection management proposal.

```rust
pub struct crust::Connection {
    transport_protocol: Protocol,
    peer_addr: SocketAddrW,
    local_addr: SocketAddrW,
}

enum ExpectedConnection {
    InternalRequest::Connect(ConnectRequest),
    InternalResponse::Connect(ConnectResponse, SignedToken)
}

::crust::Event::OnConnect(::crust::Connection)
::crust::Event::OnAccept(::crust::Connection)
::crust::Event::BootstrapFinished
::crust::Event::ExternalEndpoints(::crust::Endpoint)
```

### On ConnectRequest and on ConnectResponse

```rust
fn handle_on_connect_request(&mut self, connect_request) {
    if self.core.check_routing_node(&connect_request.requester)
        // address relocation currently still works through the connection_cache
        // this should be checked here.
        // This cache can be removed after Address Relocation has been corrected
        && self.connection_cache.contains_key(&connect_request.requester) {
        self.service.connect(connect_request.external_endpoints);
        self.core.expect_connection(connect_request.clone());
        self.send_connect_response(connect_request);
    }
}

fn handle_on_connect_response(&mut self, connect_response) {
    if self.verify_response(&connect_response) {
        self.service.connect(connect_response.external_endpoints);
        self.core.expect_connection(connect_response.clone());
    }
}
```

### On accept and on connect

```rust
fn handle_on_accept(&mut self, connection) {
    match self.core.state() {
        State::Disconnected => {
            // on assigning a name, we become State::Relocated
            self.core.assign_name(self_relocated_name);
        },
        State::Bootstrapped => { self.service.drop_node(connection); return; },
        State::Relocated => {},
        State::Connected => {},
        State::GroupConnected => {},
        State::Terminated => { self.service.drop_node(connection); return; },
    };
    self.core.add_unknown_connection(connection);
}

fn handle_on_connect(&mut self, connection) {
    match self.core.state() {
        State::Disconnected => {
            // accept as bootstrap connection
            self.core.add_bootstrap_connection(connection.clone());
            self.send_hello(connection);
            return;
        },
        State::Bootstrapped => { self.service.drop_node(connection); return;
            /* refuse connection, only have one bootstrap connection */ },
        State::Relocated => {},
        State::Connected => {},
        State::GroupConnection => {},
        State::Terminated => { self.service.drop_node(connection); return; },
    };
    match self.core.match_expected_connection(connection) {
        Some(ref mut expected_connection) => {
            expected_connection.insert_connection(connection.clone());
            self.send_hello(connection);
        },
        None => { self.service.drop_node(connection); return; },
    };
}
```

### Hello and confirmation

```rust
fn handle_hello(&mut self, connection, ::direct_message::Hello) {
    match self.core.match_unknown_connection(connection) {
        Some(unknown_connection) => {
            if hello.contains_verified_connect_response() {
                match self.core.match_request_with_response(hello, connection) {
                    Some(confirmed_connection) => self.confirm_connection(confirmed_connection);
                    None => { self.service.drop_node(connection); return; }
                };
            } else {
                unknown_connection.insert_hello(hello);
            };
        },
        None => { self.service.drop_node(connection); return; },
    };
}

fn on_confirmation(&mut self, confirmation, connection) {
    // a confirmation must always be sent on the primary connection
    match self.core.match_unknown_connection(connection) {
        Some(unknown_connection) => {
            if unknown_connection.claimant == confirmation.claimant {
                match self.core.contains_expected_connection_response(
                    confirmation.claimant) {
                    Some(secondary_connection) => {
                        self.service.
                        [TO BE CONTINUED]
                    }
                }

            }
        }
    }
}
```

NOTE: this is unfinished and the implementation for a bootstrap connection, is not integrated in the above pseudo-code.

#### Routing Core

```rust
struct RoutingCore {
    ...,
    UnknownConnections: ExpirationMap<::crust::Connection, Option<::direct_messages::Hello>>
    ExpectedConnections: ExpirationMap<::ExpectedConnection, Option<::crust::Connection>>
}
```

#### utilities

```rust
/// ExpirationMap holds the Key and Value with a timestamp but pushes
/// out the expired keys and values as a vector
struct ::utilities::ExpirationMap<K, V> where K: something {

}

impl ExpirationMap {
    pub fn with_expiry_duration(::time::Duration) {...}

    pub fn insert()
    pub fn contains_key()
    /// clean out expired state
    pub fn check_expirations() -> Vec<(K,V)>
    ...
}
```

### Updates to Existing Code

1. Merge the `RoutingNode` functions `handle_new_connection` and `handle_new_bootstrap_connection`.
1. Remove `Unidentified` connections from `ConnectionName`.
1. In the event of disconnect implement re-bootstrapping.
1. Integrate `Hello` in line with crust events and updated methodology.

## Drawbacks

A double connection is established to ensure that a connection can be made in both direction. On cryptographically establishing the valid two-way-established connection, the original connection (from network to requester) is confirmed and the secondary connection is dropped.  This imposes more work to establishing a connection, but is fundamental to ensure the correct routing topology.  It is argued that without this secondary connection it is not possible to cryptographically ensure that IP-connection is authentic to the routing connection.
