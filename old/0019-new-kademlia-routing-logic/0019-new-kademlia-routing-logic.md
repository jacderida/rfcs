## Summary

The current mechanism implemented in the [kademlia_routing_table][1] and [routing][2] crates has several weaknesses that lead to potential problems affecting security, performance and even basic functionality.

## Motivation

In the current implementation,

* routing table entries are symmetric, i. e. I can't be in your table if you are not in mine,
* the routing crate does not add enough connections to a new nodes' table to ensure the [invariant required for Kademlia](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) (3rd paragraph in "System description"),
* the `kademlia_routing_table::RoutingTable`'s methods to choose desired entries do not ensure the invariant, even if presented with enough potential entries,
* not even the original Kademlia invariant is strong enough to guarantee that messages reach every member of a target's close group, or that every node knows whether it is a member of that group,
* the parallelism feature makes the upper bound for the number of hop messages that are sent for a single message grow linearly with the network size, instead of logarithmically,
* the parallelism feature causes hop messages to be sent to messages outside the target's bucket, which does not reduce the estimate for the remaining number of hops to the target.

Some of these issues have already been demonstrated in tests: Both the `routing` crate's ci_test and deployed test networks have shown that the routing tables are insufficiently filled, and
[tests for the kademlia_routing_table](https://github.com/afck/kademlia_routing_table/blob/network_tests/src/lib.rs#L1308) crate show that even under ideal conditions, messages do not always reach their target. And finally the number of nodes that consider themselves members of a particular close group can exceed 100 - orders of magnitude above the current group size of 8.

Of course a peer-to-peer network has to deal with lots of unpredictable problems, like malicious nodes, simultaneously joining or leaving nodes, connection failures, etc., so no absolute guarantees can be made. However, we can expect to have proof that at least in the most common scenarios (e. g. one node leaves, then there is some time to adapt to the change, then a message is sent) the routing mechanism *does* make the guarantees that its users rely on.

Instead of detailing how and where the above points fail, this is a proposal to make some changes to the routing logic, together with a rigorous argument why this will make the following guarantees in common scenarios:


### Guaranteed properties

1. The number of nodes in the network with `node.is_close(target) == true` is exactly `GROUP_SIZE` for each target address.
2. Each node in a given address' close group is connected to each other node in that group. In particular, every node is connected to its own close group.
3. Each message reaches every member of the destination's close group after at most 512 hops.
4. The number of total hop messages created for each message is at most `PARALLELISM * 512`.
5. For each node there are at most 512 * `GROUP_SIZE` other nodes in the network for which it can obtain the IP address, at any point in time.

**TODO**: We should add more guarantees here, e. g.: If `PARALLELISM - 1` nodes suddenly go offline and routing tables haven't been updated yet, messages still reach their destination. Or: If two nodes are unable to directly connect to each
other, ... etc.


## Detailed design

The network will attempt to always satisfy the following invariant:


### The invariant

In every node, every bucket is maximally filled, and every node knows its close group. That means:

Whenever a bucket has less than `BUCKET_SIZE` entries, it contains *all nodes in the network* that have the corresponding bucket distance.


### Changes to the routing logic

In `kademlia_routing_table`:

* The constants are changed and a test asserts that `BUCKET_SIZE == GROUP_SIZE` and `BUCKET_SIZE >= PARALLELISM`. (Possibly remove `BUCKET_SIZE`.)
* I am allowed to connect to you (and learn about your IP address) if and only if you are in the close group of one of my *bucket address*es: an address that differs from mine in exactly one bit, (independent of whether you want me in your routing table). A new `allow_connection` method will check that.
* The `add_node` and `want_to_add` methods are modified so that we always add/want a node if its bucket does not yet have `BUCKET_SIZE` entries.
* Don't automatically drop nodes from the routing table when adding new ones.
* The `target_nodes` function is modified (and used in routing accordingly) so that only the source node of a message sends `PARALLELISM` copies of it.
* Apart from that, each node relays every copy of the message that it receives,
  and up to `PARALLELISM` copies.
* As an exception to the previous point: Any message sent to a group that the current node belongs to is relayed to the `GROUP_SIZE - 1` nodes closest to the target.
* The `is_close` method returns whether there are fewer than `GROUP_SIZE` nodes in the routing table which are closer to the target than `self`.

In routing:

* Whenever a node joins or leaves, all routing tables are updated so that the invariant is satisfied. (See below for details.)
* Raise churn events if the lost or new node belongs to *any* close group that we are a member of, not just *our* close group. (See below.)

See the appendix below for proofs that the invariant and these changes will guarantee the desired properties.


### Node insertion

After adding its close group to the routing table, a new node knows that only the buckets up to the first one that currently has an entry can potentially have entries. (Nodes in later buckets would belong to the close group!) For each such
bucket `i` that is not full (i. e. has `GROUP_SIZE` entries) yet, the node sends a `GetCloseGroup` request to the `NaeManager` of its `i`-th bucket address.

The group verifies that it is one the sender's bucket addresses and the sender is therefore allowed to connect to its members. It responds with the groups' public IDs to the new node. The node then exchanges its endpoints with each of the members and establishes the connections.

At that point, the invariant holds true for the new node's routing table. But it might still fail at another node `n` with bucket index `i`, whose `i`-th bucket is not full.

This can only happen if there were less than `GROUP_SIZE` nodes `m` in the network before that had `bi(n, m) == i`. If such nodes exist, then some of them have just connected to the new node and they know that their `i`-th bucket was not full before.

So whenever a node `n` adds a new node to a bucket `i` that was not full, `n` needs to make sure that *all* nodes `m` in the network with `bi(m, n) > i` are notified. To do that, it sends a `Churn` message to *all* entries from its `i + 1`-th bucket onwards. Since all nodes that receive the event do the same,
this will reach every node with `bi(m, n) > i`. (In a balanced network with an even distribution of addresses, this should rarely be substantially more than `GROUP_SIZE` nodes.)


### Node removal

Since we keep connections open to each routing table entry, every contact of a leaving node learns about the removal. (Should we change that, a periodic check needs to be introduced.)

If a node loses a connection in a bucket that is not full, no action needs to be taken: Because of the invariant, the remaining nodes in that bucket are *all* there are in the network with the given bucket index.

If the bucket was full before, the entry probably needs to be replaced. To do that, the node sends another `GetPublicIdWithEndpoints` request to the bucket address of the modified bucket, as if it had just joined, to obtain the contact information of the *new* close group of its `i`-th bucket and refill it.


### Churn

If a node is joining or leaving, the upper layers are informed about it so that they can adapt to the change in the network, e. g. restore the desired replication number of data chunks. The nodes that need to act on this are those which are in any close group together with the new/lost node.

If the new/lost node `n` is/was in any non-full bucket, this is the case: We and the lost node are then both close to that bucket address.

If the bucket `i` is full, then we are not close to any address that disagrees with us in the `i`-th place, so the question is whether `n` is close to any other address we are close to. If we have `GROUP_SIZE - 1` or more contacts with higher indices, this is not the case: These would all be closer than `n`. Otherwise it *is* the case: Ourselves and `n` are in the close group of `n`'s
`i`-th bucket address.

So a `Churn` event needs to be raised if `n` is in a non-full bucket or we have less than `GROUP_SIZE - 1` contacts with a bucket index greater than `n`'s.


## Drawbacks

The expected routing table size for a network with `2‚Åø` nodes will be about `GROUP_SIZE * n`. Each of these entries currently corresponds to at least one open connection and two threads. It would therefore be desirable to reduce the routing table size.


## Unresolved questions

The idea behind group authorities (close groups) as well as parallelism (sending the message along more than one path) is to provide security and redundancy. However, the former measure can easily bypassed if the latter is undermined: A single node could invent a whole close group and claim that it is relaying messages from them. The recipient usually doesn't know the sender: They neither know their public keys, nor do they know the network layout around the sender, so they don't know whether the sender actually *is* close to the source address, nor whether the sender is a legitimate node at all.

One idea to prevent this kind of attack would rely on the parallel paths of a message never intersecting:

* Every hop node signs the public key of the previous node: They have them in their routing table and know that it's a legitimate node, in the sense that it was added to the network via the bootstrap procedure. All these keys and signatures are passed along with the message until it reaches its destination.
* Every copy of a message except the first one is *bounced back* to the previous hop node, and that tries to route it via another contact. That way the `PARALLELISM` copies of the message will have taken four completely different routes to the target.

The target node then has `PARALLELISM` uninterrupted chains of signatures: I know A and A signed B and B signed C and C sent the message. For the message to be faked, *each* of these paths would have to contain one of the attacker's nodes.

By making `PARALLELISM` big enough this might make attacks infeasible: If the attacker controls a percentage `a` of a network with `2‚Åø` nodes, the chance to intercept any given path of length `n` is about `1 - (1 - a)‚Åø`, and the chance to intercept *all* `p = PARALLELISM` paths is about `(1 - (1 - a)‚Åø)·µñ`. E. g. in a network with a million nodes (`n = 20`) and `p = 8`, an attacker who controls 5% of nodes (`a = 5%`, 50.000 nodes) would still have a chance of success of about `3%`.

Maybe there are ways to change the routing algorithm so that the paths of the copies usually stay disjoint by themselves, so that too many bounces can be avoided? A few wild ideas:

* A copy could be numbered from the beginning, and copy `n` could always be routed via the `n`-th closest node to the target, instead of the closest one. This might make it likely, but not impossible, that the paths never collide. (We will need to count bounces in tests to verify that, probably also using a highly imbalanced network to simulate one path in a very large network.)
* Nodes could have one of `GROUP_SIZE` colours. A close group consists of one node in each colour: the single closest node to the target with that colour. Every message copy is routed via a path that stays exclusively in one colour, until it reaches the destination, making it *impossible* for the copies to collide. This would change the routing algorithm considerably: Instead of one table with bucket size `GROUP_SIZE`, each node would have to keep `GROUP_SIZE` tables - one for each colour - with bucket size 1.


## Alternatives

If the routing table size turns out to be too large in practice, we could let connections time out: Entries we haven't communicated with within some period of time are disconnected, without being removed from the routing table. The
connection is reestablished periodically to check whether the node is still there, as well as whenever we need to route messages via them. This should allow us to keep only `PARALLELISM` connections open per bucket most of the time.

We could also experiment with smaller values for `GROUP_SIZE` and `PARALLELISM`, but we need to make sure that that doesn't compromise security.

Finally, if it turns out to be a problem that we never drop nodes (it shouldn't, because we are only allowed to add nodes that are close to one of our bucket addresses anyway), nodes could periodically send `IDontWantToTalkToYouAnymore` messages to every entry in an overflowing bucket except the `BUCKET_SIZE` closest ones to the bucket address. The other node then drops the connection if it also doesn't need it anymore.


## Appendix: Proofs

We prove that whenever the invariant holds, the desired properties are guaranteed.

Let `bd(x, y)` be the bucket distance between two addresses `x` and `y`, `x ^ y` the XOR distance, and `bi(x, y) = 512 - bd(x, y)` the bucket index. Equivalently, the `bi(x, y)`-th bit is the first (most significant) one where `x` and `y` disagree.


### Lemma 1

`y` is XOR-closer to `x` than `z` if and only if `y` agrees with `x` in the most significant bit where `y` disagrees with `z`. That is, the following are equivalent:

* `x ^ y < x ^ z`
* `x` and `y` agree in the `bi(y, z)`-th bit.
* `x` and `z` disagree in the `bi(y, z)`-th bit.

**Proof:**
`x ^ y < x ^ z` means that in the most significant bit where `x ^ y` and `x ^ z` disagree, `x ^ y` has a 0. But `x ^ y` and `x ^ z` disagree in the same bits as `y` and `z`, i. e. they first disagree in the `bi(y, z)`-th bit. Since `x ^ y` has a 0 there, that means that `x` and `y` agree there. Similarly, since `x ^ z` is 1 in that place, `x` and `z` disagree there.


### Lemma 2

If `n` is in the close group to `d`, it has every node `m` in its routing table which is *even closer* to `d`.

**Proof:**
By Lemma 1, `m` is closer to `d` if and only if `d` and `n` agree in the `bi(m, n)`-th digit, i. e. if `m` would belong in a bucket `i` of `n` such that `d ^ n` has a `0` in the `i`-th position. In other words, the nodes closer to `d` than `n` are exactly those which belong in such a bucket. If there were `GROUP_SIZE` of them, `n` wouldn't be close to `d`, so there are less than
`GROUP_SIZE` of them, which means none of these buckets is full. Therefore `m` is actually in one of those buckets of `n` because of the invariant.


### Property 1

If a node is among the `GROUP_SIZE` closest nodes in the network, it cannot have `GROUP_SIZE` other, closer nodes in its routing table. Therefore `is_close` returns `true`.

For the converse, assume there are `GROUP_SIZE` nodes that are closer to the target `t` than our node's address `n`. That such a node `c` is closer to `t` means `t ^ c < t ^ n`, which by Lemma 1 is equivalent to `c` belonging in the `i`-th bucket of `n` for some `i` such that `n` and `t` disagree in the `i`-th bit. Since by the invariant each such bucket contains either *all* nodes with that bucket distance or `GROUP_SIZE` such nodes, the routing table then has at least `GROUP_SIZE` such entries `c`.


### Property 2

Let `n` and `m` be in the close group of `d`. Without loss of generality assume that `n` is closer to `d`. Then by Lemma 2, `m` has `n` in its routing table. Therefore, the two are connected.

### Property 3

Thanks to property 2, we only have to show that the message reaches the node closest to the destination `d`, as from there it will directly be sent to all the other close nodes.

For that, we show that every node `n` that is not closest to `d` increases the number of *good* leading bits in the next hop:

A bit `i` is *good* for `n` if either `n ^ x` is 0 in that bit, or `n`'s `i`-th bucket is empty.

Let the current node `n` not be closest to the destination `d`, and assume that the first `i` bits are good. The message is sent to the entry `m` in `n`'s routing table which is closest to `d`, so we need to prove that `m` has at least `i + 1` good leading bits.

Since `m` minimizes the distance to `d` among the table entries, it must be in the first non-empty bucket `k` of `n` such that `n` and `d` disagree in the `k`-th bit. Thus the `k`-th is the first bit that is not good for `n`, that is, `k = i + 1`. Since `m` and `d` agree there, it is, however, good for `m`.

If we can show that the first `i` bits are also still good for `m`, then it follows that `m` has in fact at least `i + 1` good leading bits:

But `m` and `n` agree in the first `i` bits. So wherever `n ^ x` has a 0, `m ^ x` also does. Also, the nodes with bucket distance `j` for every `j <= i` are the same, so whenever `n`'s `j`-th bucket is empty, the invariant implies that there are no nodes with that bucket distance in the network and therefore `m`'s `j`-th bucket must also be empty.


### Property 4

This follows immediately from Property 3, since only `PARALLELISM` different messages are created by the sender.


### Property 5

There are `512` bucket addresses, and each of them has only `GROUP_SIZE` close nodes.
